# TP5400_tested_PCB
This is TP5400 PCB and Schematic diagram which were all actually produced and tested and passed
attention: The chip is work after connected to the battery.

这是一个TP5400芯片的测试PCB和原理图，我已经测试并生产出来，确保他们的功能都正常。
注意，该芯片需要正常接入电池才能工作。

文件里包含立创EDA和AD的文件，希望对你有帮助。你可以调整R2的值来改变充电电流，I = 1100 /R2.

The repositor is included easyEDA and Altium Designer files,I hope it can help you.
Your can change the R2 resistance to change the charge current,I = 1100/ R2.
